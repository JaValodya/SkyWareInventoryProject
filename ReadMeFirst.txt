This file contains instructions for managing  
the project "SkyWereInwentoryProject" as a team:
================================================
Git Network:

master branch --------------------------------------------------->
       workingbranch brnch -------------------------------------->
            konstantin branch ----------------------------------->
            delbar branch --------------------------------------->
            kamil branch ---------------------------------------->
            fatih branch ---------------------------------------->
            volodymyr branch ------------------------------------>

Working in the git network:

     --Please work only at the branch with your name;
       Hint: 
            +1+ to check available branches use command "git branch" (branch you are currently in 
                will be highlighted in green)  
            +2+ to switch between branch use command "git checkout [branch name]"
                ([branch name] - name of the branch you want to switch to )
                
     -- use "git add" and "git push" only to the branch with your name;
     -- Please do not commit to the 'workingbranch' or 'muster' branches;
     -- Before starting work on the project make sure you have the latest version of the project:
        Step 1: run "git pull" commant when you are on the 'workingbranch' ( See Hint: +2+)
